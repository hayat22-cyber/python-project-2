This project analyzes weather data to identify temperature trends, rainfall patterns, and extreme weather conditions.
The goal is to understand climate behavior using data analysis and visualization techniques in Python.



Dataset Description

The dataset contains weather-related information with the following columns:
Date – The date of the record
Temperature – Daily temperature in Celsius
Rainfall – Rainfall in mm
Humidity – Percentage of humidit
WindSpeed – Wind speed in km/h
The data was cleaned by converting dates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency.




Key Insights
Temperature Trends
Temperature varies over time with noticeable fluctuations.
Certain periods show higher temperatures indicating hot weather conditions.

Rainfall Analysis
Rainfall distribution shows most days receive low to moderate rainfall.
A few days experience heavy rainfall events.

Extreme Weather Events
Hot days (temperature above average) were identified.
Heavy rainfall days (rainfall above average) were fewer but significant.

Correlation Analysis
Temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed are correlated.
Understanding these correlations helps predict weather patterns.




Weather Insights
Temperature and rainfall patterns help in understanding seasonal behavior.
Extreme weather days can impact daily life, agriculture, and infrastructure.
Historical weather data is useful for climate trend analysis.





Recommendations
Monitor temperature trends to prepare for heat waves.
Plan infrastructure and drainage systems for heavy rainfall days.
Use long-term weather data for better forecasting and planning.






Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how weather data can be processed and visualized in Python to extract meaningful insights.
The charts and extreme weather identification can help with decision-making and planning for climate-sensitive activities.
