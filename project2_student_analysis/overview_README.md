This project analyzes student performance data to understand subject-wise scores, pass/fail rates, and the relationship between attendance and academic performance. The objective is to derive meaningful educational insights using data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques in Python.










Dataset Description

The dataset contains student records with the following fields:

StudentID
Name
Gender
Age
Math
English
Science
Attendance

The data was cleaned by ensuring numeric values for scores, calculating average scores, and adding a Pass/Fail column based on a threshold average score of 40.





Key Insights

Pass/Fail Analysis
Majority of students passed, indicating good overall performance.
A few students failed, highlighting areas where support is needed.

Subject Performance
Average marks show that students perform best in [insert best subject, e.g., Science].

Attendance vs Performance
Students with higher attendance tend to have higher average scores.
Attendance appears positively correlated with performance.



Educational Insights
Strong attendance is associated with better academic outcomes.
Subjects with low average scores may require extra teaching support.
Early identification of students at risk of failing can help improve overall results.









Recommendations

Encourage students to maintain high attendance.
Provide remedial sessions for subjects with lower average scores.
Monitor students flagged as failing and provide extra guidance.
Use data to personalize teaching strategies and improve learning outcomes.





Conclusion
The analysis provides actionable insights that can help teachers and administrators improve student performance. Data-driven approaches allow early intervention, targeted support, and better overall academic outcomes.
